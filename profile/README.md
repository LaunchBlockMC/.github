LaunchBlock is a all in one deployment, build and hosting platform for Minecraft. We allow people to quickly get their game from plan to players. It's as simple as creating a GitHub repository with your server files, hopping into our panel, grabbing the ip and inviting players!

## ðŸ“– Documentation
If you've landed here to read how to interact with our services, check out our [documentation](https://docs.launchblock.gg)!

## ðŸ‘€ Open source projects
At LaunchBlock, we believe every touch point should be open, to make it easier to develop advanced games on our platform! We keep things simple for the average user - but allow for large extensibility and customisation for advanced users.

As a result, we have a handful of open-source API, SDK, Documentation and Plugin repositories.
